## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ardi!

I'm a software engineer based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, passionate about building scalable web applications with **JavaScript, TypeScript, and React**. Iâ€™m open to remote opportunities worldwide.

I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and solving complex problems that drive meaningful impact. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually exploring the latest tech trends or sharing what Iâ€™ve learned.

I regularly share insights on technology, career growth, and life as a developer on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/ardizanki7). Letâ€™s connect â€” Iâ€™d love to learn from your journey too!
