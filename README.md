## ðŸ‘‹ Hey hey!

I'm Ardi, a QA Engineer with 6 years of hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing. My expertise includes API testing with Postman, end-to-end testing with Playwright, CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, database validation using SQL, and organizing structured test cases using spreadsheets.

Currently, alongside my work as a QA Engineer, I'm transitioning into Software Engineering to buildÂ modern and scalable web applications. In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
